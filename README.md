# MachineLearning
In this project I used Natural Language Processing to predict the sentiment of the tweets extracted from airlines dataset .
The tweets were positive , negative and neutral tweets.
I have trained the model using various algorithms like SVMs , Neural Networks ,Random Forest Classifier , naive bayes and observed that naive babyes perform the best in this type of ternary classification.
